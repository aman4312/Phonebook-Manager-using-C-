Project: Phonebook Manager using C++

Developed a Phonebook Manager application using C++ and data structures, particularly linked lists, to efficiently store and manage contact information.
Implemented core functionalities, including adding, displaying, searching, and deleting contacts in the phonebook.
Ensured proper memory management to avoid resource leakage and implemented robust input validation to handle edge cases and invalid user inputs.
Addressed the challenge of potential duplicate contacts by implementing logic to prevent redundant entries.
Recognized the importance of search efficiency and discussed potential improvements, such as implementing binary search or using advanced data structures like hash tables or balanced binary search trees.
Envisioned future enhancements, such as adding data persistence to store contacts beyond program termination and developing a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
Through this project, solidified C++ programming skills and gained hands-on experience with data structures and problem-solving in a real-world scenario.
