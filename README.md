✔ <h2><b>Project: Phonebook Manager using C++</b></h2>

➡ Developed a Phonebook Manager application using C++ and data structures, particularly linked lists, to efficiently store and manage contact information.<br>
➡ Implemented core functionalities, including adding, displaying, searching, and deleting contacts in the phonebook.<br>
➡ Ensured proper memory management to avoid resource leakage and implemented robust input validation to handle edge cases and invalid user inputs.<br>
➡ Addressed the challenge of potential duplicate contacts by implementing logic to prevent redundant entries.<br>
➡ Recognized the importance of search efficiency and discussed potential improvements, such as implementing binary search or using advanced data structures like 
  hash tables or balanced binary search trees.<br>
➡ Envisioned future enhancements, such as adding data persistence to store contacts beyond program termination and developing a graphical user interface for a more 
   user-friendly experience.<br>
➡Through this project, solidified C++ programming skills and gained hands-on experience with data structures and problem-solving in a real-world scenario.<br>
